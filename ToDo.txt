Overall App Workflow:

* index.jsx loads App.jsx
* App sends GET request to DB to get object w/ relatedHouses Property
* GET request is for specific house based on houseItem #
* App passes relatedHousesArray to HomesList as a prop
* HomesList has state called displayedHouses (originally set to an empty array, should be an array with 3 objects after componentDidMount calls setCurrentDisplay fn)
* HomesList has setCurrentDisplay function that sets this.state.displayedHouses using props passed from App
* HomesList renders CurrentDisplay component
* HomesList passes CurrentDisplay this.state.displayedHouses
* CurrentDisplay displays 3 houseObjects recieved as prop
* HomesList renders two buttons to move carousel forward or back
* HomesListButtons have onClick event which invokes function
* HomesList has handleClick fn that uses setCurrentDisplay fn to update this.state.displayedHouses
